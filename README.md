# ClipboardInvert
This program inverts the colors of the image in your clipboard.

# USE
To use it, screenshot, copy or snip an image, so that it is in your clipboard. \
Run Invert.bat (it just compiles the program, then runs it). \
A terminal will open and close. \
Now you have the inverted image in your clipboard, which you can paste wherever you would like. \

I personally made a windows shortcut file in the start menu, so that when I wish to invert an image, I just open the menu, type invert, run it, and it's done.
